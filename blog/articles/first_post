<p>Hey everyone! I guess this is the first post, the neovim one doesn't count because it was published pre-v0.0.1.
    That's what I just keep telling myself.
</p>
<p>I don't have much to say, I really just wanted to learn how to put something together with the
    <a href="https://go.dev/">Go Programming Language</a> standard library and deploying to a certified k8 distribution like
    <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a> on my home arm64 based custer. I'll describe that in a later post :)
</p>
<p>
    I also don't have a solid plan for this website... other than keep it simple place to showcase my experience and
    resume, fun, and a place for me to learn by doing.. Maybe some dad-joke apis, bootstrap styling, maybe some frontend javascript? 
    I don't know! We'll see where the wind takes us.
</p>
