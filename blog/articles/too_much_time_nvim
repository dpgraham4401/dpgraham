<h3>I'm spending too much time maintaining neovim configs</h3>
<p>At a certain point, i need to just get what i'm trying to do done. I don't really want to learn a scripting language just to 
    put maintain my text editor... however great it may be.

    it seems like once every 3-6 months, you start having problems because a plugin. 
    Once I start pulling on that thread, it turns into a whole day of tearing down the configs and 
    starting from scratch, or at least it feels like it.

    On the other side, there's not a single editor that comes close such as smooth, distraction free 
    neovim configured just the way you like it. 

There is no love lost for VS-code and all it's variants (sorry open source version). 
GoLand and Pycharm are pretty dope (nice UI, relatively intuitive) but I only have them
because my free student account licenses hasn't expired. After that, they just bloated, 
propiertary single-lang things that don't play well with a tiling window manager. 
The vim extension/plugins just never quite give you the 
same feel, or just don't react as I would expect sometime
