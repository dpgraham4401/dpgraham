    I've finally bought a new laptop! I replaced the 10-year-old laptop I had before, with a new macbook m1 air...
    I've used macs before, my first laptop was a macbook, but I haven't used it one as a daily driver since
    2016? Now I'm remembering why.

    There's no denying macOS is a nice, polished OS; and I'm not experiencing buyers remorse (not yet at least).
    But MacOS clearly has a design philosophy... Apple's way, or the highway. It seems more effort than it's worth to
    try to configure a keyboard centric workflow with MacOS. Everythin' depends on the trackpad, which has gotta be
    the slowest way to get things done.

    I primarily bought it because I'm banking on the effort of the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">The Asahi
    linux Project</a>. They just released their <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/">
    first alpha release</a> and even without GPU acceleration, the display is still usable. Still plenty of features
    not working, but it's very exciting to see Linux on the M1 hardware! If you want to help out, you can check out
    the <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux">Asahi GitHub repo</a> (you could also
    <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/marcan">sponsor them financially</a>).
